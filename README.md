This repositoru contains a number of Python Scripts for Downloading TLE files and converting results to LAT Long
All TLEs are downloaded from SpaceTrack.org which requires a user account
There are two conversions to lat long one has the TLE embeded and not very useful but was great for debugging 
The other file calls the TLE files from txt file which contains the TLE data 
The ddownload TLE file only down loads data as defined in a CSV file makes thisngs very quick
